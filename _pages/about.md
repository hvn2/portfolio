## About Me  
I’m Han Van Nguyen, an Electrical and Computer Engineer with a Ph.D. from the University of Iceland. My expertise lies in AI, computer vision, software development, and remote sensing. With experience in both industry (e.g., Visk ehf.) and academia (e.g., University of Iceland), I’m passionate about solving real-world problems using cutting-edge technology.  

Currently, I’m seeking opportunities in computer engineering, software engineering, AI, and research roles where I can apply my skills in Python, TensorFlow, and hardware design.
